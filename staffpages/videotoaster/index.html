Official Letter of Resignation
-------
I joined Generic Linux when it was fun. It used to just be a bunch
of nerdy teenagers trying their best to get something to work. It
used to be about poking fun at a friend's code spaghetti and having
a good laugh. But ever since we became "genericlinux.org" instead
of "genericlinux.warsawpakt.xyz", leaks started to appear. The ship
was sinking. And then I had to go away, and the leaks grew and grew,
and there was nothing to be done.

We're trying to solve the problem of disgruntled, inexperienced devs
who really aren't ready for this type of stuff, by throwing more
disgruntled, inexperienced devs at it.

How many monkeys does it take to make a Linux distribution? Minus one.

Want me back?

Pakt - patch those damn leaks. Take on some form of leadership. Make
it more obvious what you want done.

Everyone - stop being elitist. It's about having fun and being generic,
not about "gnome bad xfce good" and "openbox is bad" or "____ is my
favorite and i'm generic so it's generic"

Everyone - take on your roles. Do what you need to do. Do what you came
here to do. If you're an astronaut, you don't sail the seven seas. You
go to space. If you're a programmer, you don't have say-so in design
unless there is no designer.

And right now there isn't one.
